# Collection types

In every programming language, collection types refer to data types that can store multiple values. Python's collection types can store multiple values of different types.

- List:  is a collection which is ordered and mutable. Allows duplicate members.
- Tuple: is a collection which is ordered and immutable. Allows duplicate members.
- Set: is a collection which is unordered, immutable, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- Dictionary: is a key-value based collection which is ordered [py >= 3.7] and mutable. No duplicate members.

> Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
