# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.

In python,

- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular data type, and can even change type after they have been set.

> Use the type() function to get the data type of a variable.

# Variable names

- Can only contain alpha-numeric characters (A-Z 0-9) and underscores (_), but cannot start with a number
- Cannot be any of python's reserved keywords

> Variable names are case-sensitive: first != First
