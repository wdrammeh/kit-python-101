# Problem

Write a program that reads an arithmetic statement from a user input and prints the answer (result).

**Note**

- You must implement exception handling
- The user should be able to continue using the program for as long as they want
- Terminate the program when the user enters "q"
- Write all result to a log file

# Example

```
> 23 + 56
> 79
> 67 - 11
> 56
> 55+4j
> Error
> 4 * 5
> 20
> 16 / 2
> 8
> 10 mod 3
> 1
```
