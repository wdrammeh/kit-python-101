# Math Quiz

Write a program that randomly generates a simple arithmetic expression of only one operator and two numbers. Give the random expression as a question to the user and print True if they answer right, False otherwise.

**Note**:

- You must implement exception handling
- The user should be able to continue using the program for as long as they want
- Terminate the program when the user enters "q"
- Write all result to a log file
- Show the total score upon exit, in values and in percentage
- Re-implement the solution using OOP

# Example

```
> 6 + 7
> 13
> True
> 50 - 40
> 20
> False
> 5 * 7
> 40
> False
> 50 / 5
> 10
> True
> 12 mod 2
> 0
> True
> q
> Total score: 3/5 (60%)
```
